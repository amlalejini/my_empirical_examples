This repository contains a random assortment of Empirical examples (mostly web examples) that I didn't feel like giving their own repository.

**WARNING**: Once I hack out one of these examples, it will probably collect digital dust. i.e. I have no intention to keep these up-to-date.

# Listing:
## EventDrivenGP-Roles-LSVis
Old proof of concept application that runs an EventDrivenGP program in the Role-ID deme environment.

## KMeansClusteringExample
Empirical web application for my IBIO 851 stats course: interactive demo of the k-means clustering algorithm.

## simple_physics_example
Old physics example. Does it still compile with the most recent version of Empirical: certainly not.

## Everything in the OLD directory
Shit that's old and out of date, but I haven't nuked yet.
